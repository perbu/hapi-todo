# Hapi-todo

A simple todo app built with Hapi.js and Angular.

WIP

## Motivation

I did this to get an idea of what idiomatic Hapi.js would look like, written in TypeScript.

This isn't meant to be used for anything other than learning.

## Dependencies
 - TypeScript
 - Hapi.js
 - Sqlite (the repo)
 - Angular 
 - Jest
